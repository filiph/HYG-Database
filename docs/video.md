Hi, my name is Filip and I made a 2D map of space. That doesn't sound like much, I know, but
bear with me.

We already have a 2D map of the stars - it's called the night sky. The problem with this map
is that it's lying. For example, looking at the sky, you'd think that the two stars are close
to each other and roughly the same brightness. But they're actually hundreds of light years away and
the farther one is many times brighter than the close one.

On the other hand, you'd think that these two stars are far from each other, but they're actually
10x closer to each other than those previous 2 stars.

If you take a group of stars on the night sky, chances are they are extremely far from each other.

It's not a map, it's a view.

We have other 2D views of stars, of course, and they all have the same issue. For example, this map
is just a flattening of the 3D space around our star (the Sun). But again, these two stars are
actually farther from each other than these two stars. And these two. And the two.

People can use 3D maps now. But people are also really bad at using 3D maps. With a 2D map, everyone
can instantly see that there is a couple of cities here that are close to each other. But in a 3D
simulation, this is actually pretty hard. You have to look in all directions all the time. You can't
easily "circle" a bunch of stars. You can't plan a tour.

This is why pretty much all movies and books and computer games
show star maps as being 2D, or at least "almost 2d". And their maps are almost always completely
made up, with made up star systems or systems in the wrong places.

So, let's make a better 2D map than those we already have.

To be clear, there is no perfect solution to making a 2D map of space. Making a 2D map of objects
in 3D is painfully similar to making a 1D map of objects in 2D. Imagine trying to make a 1D map of
Earth's cities. There's just no way to make it perfect. (Santiago de Chile vs Montreal, Cape Town vs
Stockholm, Perth vs Beijing).

But, there's a way to make a map that is kind of true to reality. It's just really hard to do.
Fortunately, we now have powerful computers that can do the hard work for us.

So, imagine there are only 4 stars in the universe. They're in this constelation (tetrahedron). How
would you draw a map of such a universe? The naive approach would be to use a view, such as this. But
this view is lying because it looks like this star is in the midst of the remaining three, which
we know is definitely not true. Every star is exactly the same distance from each other star. You can't do
that in 2D. But you can do something that's good enough. (I.e. it's not completely wrong.)

If you want, pause the video now and think how you would make the 2D map of this constelation so
it almost preserves the spatial relations of these 4 stars.

Ok, so the best we can do is this: a square. The 4 stars are almost the same distance to each
other. Nothing is in between them. And they make a nice cluster. It's a hard decision, but it's
the best we can do.

Ok, now imagine doing this not for 4 stars, but for 4000 stars.

Fortunately, we don't need to do that manually. Something called Self-Organizing Maps helps. It's
a machine learning algorithm invented by prof. Kohonen and it basically allows the computer to
start with a completely random map, and tweak it until it's as good as it gets.

This takes time. The map that I have here took XX hours to compute. But that's still a bazillion
times less than if _I_ tried to make it.

Also, obviously, it's not perfect. But, at least you can be reasonably sure that if you draw a
circle around some stars, those stars will be close to each other. If you draw a route, that route
will more or less make sense even in reality.

Allright, and that's it. The map is public domain. You can use it whichever way you'd like. There's
even a hexagonal version.

If you want, you can order a mug or a poster from CafePress or http://www.replayphotos.com/. So you
can always be planning your galactic conquest, even when sipping your coffee in the morning.
